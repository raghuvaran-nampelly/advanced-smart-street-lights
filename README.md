# advanced-smart-street-lights
This project controls street lights automatically using an Arduino. The lights turn on sequentially when a sensor detects low light conditions or the presence of a vehicle or pedestrian. Once the vehicle or pedestrian has passed, the lights will turn off in reverse order, conserving energy.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LEDs (6 units representing street lights)
- Resistors (220 ohms for each LED)
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) or PIR Sensors (2 units) for detecting vehicles or pedestrians
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or PCB

- ## How to Upload the Code
1. Connect the Arduino to your computer.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code into a new sketch.
3. Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
4. Click the upload button to transfer the code to the Arduino.
